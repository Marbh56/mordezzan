                At 4th, 8th, or 12th level (players choice), when a new wepaon
                mastery is gained, fighters may elect to intensify their
                training with an already mastered weapon. With this weapon the
                fighter becomes a grand master (+2 "to hit" and +2 damage,
                increased attack rate etc.) A fighter may achieve grand mastery
                with but one weapon.
